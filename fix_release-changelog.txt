ADDITIONS:
Frisian Empire.
Coronations will now start with a selection of the priest who will perform it. The options given are "Religious Head", "High ranking in-realm priests" such as a cardinal, or "Any in-realm priest" e.g. bishop or lord spiritual. The choice influences the cost of the coronation, and prestige and piety gain. Finally, different types of coronations will give traits with different benefits. Being coronated by the religious head will give a trait that brings in more prestige.
