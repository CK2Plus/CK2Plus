Greco-Persian melting pot culture.
Greater Israel, Eretz Yisrael Hashlemah, can be founded if you own the most of the land from Egypt to the Euphrates
Israeli culture will appear in Greater Israel as a melting pot of the various Jewish cultures. Unlike other melting pots however those of Jewish religion but not a Jewish culture will also become Israeli due to the close tie that Jewish culture and religion have.
If Israel exists Jewish communites from around the world will slowly return to Israel. Those communities will settle in a province and convert the culture and religion of that province along with it.
