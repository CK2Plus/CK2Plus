fin_pantheon_unification;Convoke Great Assembly to unify the pantheon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fin_pantheon_unification_desc;The pantheon of the Finns is disordered. Each region, each tribe and even each family has its own gods. The names are repeated, but the features and ideas can be different. In order to ever reform our faith this must be remedied!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fin_writing_off_scriptures;Work on holy book;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fin_writing_off_scriptures_desc;All of the so called 'civilized' religions have holy books. A story starting with the creation of the world, containing tales about heroes and the workings of the universe, prophecies of the future, list of demons and what gods want from us - it all will be systematized and written, if we are successful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fin_religious_institutions;Create religious institutions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fin_religious_institutions_desc;The other so called 'civilized' religions have institutions. Their functions range from giving charity to the poor to serving as a supply of literate administrators to rulers. This is one of the things enabling them to lure away people from our ancestral wisdow. We need to make our own so we can be the ones converting foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fin_reform_option_1;Centralized reformation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fin_reform_option_1_desc;Hierarchy, structure, discipline - these are the things our religion needs to survive. We must create a temple which can compete with the cathedrals of our enemies, so the Finnic world will accept the guidance of our new highest priest!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fin_reform_option_2;Start reforming our faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fin_reform_option_2_desc;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fin_reform_option_3;Start reforming our faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fin_reform_option_3_desc;Curiosity and an investigation in the nature of the spirits - theis is what our religion needs to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

# Events
desc_Plus.4400;We have enough religious authority to invite a great number of holy men come to join our great assembly. The greatest minds of the Finnic religious world lead dispute about "which gods is who or what it is". The work will take a long time and there is no certainty of success... Success means a chance to progress our religion. But failure would be utmost embarrasing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4400;We hope for success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4401;After long disputes, fierce discussions, many prayers (and sometimes fights) a single common pantheon was established. Now it is no longer important whether you are in Mordvinia, Perm or Livonia - all (read: most) shamans can agree on the attributes of the types of spirits and the identities of the most common gods. It's still a long way before our religion is considered 'civilized', but it is a good omen for the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4401;Praise Ukko!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4402;Our assembly, where the priests had to make order out of polytheistic chaos, failled. A quarrel started: In place of the strength of arguments and the power of faith, they used stones, fists, curses and knives. To prevent a slaughter an intervention of armed guards was neccesarrily. Could our failure be the will of the spirits?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4402;Bad news...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
name_Plus.4403;[From.GetTitledName] begins the first step of the reformation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4403;The World of the Cross is increasingly threatening our old ways. Some great shamans suggested that in order to survive this pressure we have to modernize. A ruler called a Great Assembly, to which all the important shamans were invited, in order to establish both a common, united pantheon and strengthen our theology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4403;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
name_Plus.4404;[From.GetTitledName] succesfully completed the first step of the Finnic reformation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4404;The Finns succeeded in standardizing their pantheon. Now it is no longer important whether you are in Livonia, Perm or Finland - most of the Finnic shamans now (mostly) agree on the attributes, roles and importance of their gods and different types of spirits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4404;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optB_Plus.4404;Pff, do they really think it will change anything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
name_Plus.4405;[From.GetTitledName] failed in his attempt to progress the Finnic religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4405;The assembly of the Finnic priests succumbed into infighting! We do not know quite what happened, but a few shamans were killed and several beaten. The fact that the priests could not agree on what they believe, discredited the Finnic faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4405;Bad news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optB_Plus.4405;How predictable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4406;We finished work on Holy Book of the Finns. It has been called "The legends" and show for most important for the priests. Despite some comments, they acknowledged that the book shows the true teachings imparted by the Gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4406;Praise Ukko!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4407;We finished work on Holy Book of the Finns. It has been called "Myths and tales" and show for most important for the priests. Unfortunately, after reading they considered it as a collection of stories that do not make any meaningful whole. There is no reason to consider that our work telling the truth about the world of humans, gods and monsters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4407;Bad news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
name_Plus.4408;[From.GetTitledName] succesfully completed the second step of the Finnic reformation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
descA_Plus.4408;A Finnic Holy Book was created! Envoys gathered, selected and cleaned up the myths, legends, prophecies etc. From that moment on religious knowledge it is structured and codified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
descB_Plus.4408;The shamans of the frozen northern lands seem to have gathered together to create some sort of 'holy book', containing their different superstitions and myths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4408;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optB_Plus.4408;What a pagan holy book? That's an oxymoron.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4409;A few of the wise men we invited for our book, ended up in a disagreement about the nature of the gods and spirits. It is running out of hand and slowing down our work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4409;I'll use my learning to create some sort of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optB_Plus.4409;I'll side with whoever my loyal [Root.GetMyLordSpiritualName] says is right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optC_Plus.4409;Don't ask me about the nature of the divine it is above human understanding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optD_Plus.4409;I don't care about the nature of our gods. I only don't want to bow to the pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4410;We finished work on our religious institutions. Now, we are very close to reforming our religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4410;Praise Ukko!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4411;Our attempt to at creating religious institutions didn't went as we hoped. Whilst we did succeed in teaching the legends in our religious schools and managed to organize charity, it feels like something is missing. They just operate next to each other without forming some sort of greater whole. This isn't some sort of embarresement, but it isn't what we wanted either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4411;Bad news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
name_Plus.4412;[From.GetTitledName] succesfully completed the third step of the Finnic reformation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4412;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4412;Good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optB_Plus.4412;What next? A pagan pope?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4413;Now we have started work on our institutions it is time to decide on which aspect we should place our largest focus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4413;On the pragmatic, everything must have both a practical and a spiritual function.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optB_Plus.4413;On charity, a man who helps his fellow man gets helped in return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optC_Plus.4413;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4414;The ancient Finnic religion is proving unable to withstand the onslaught of the Cross and the Moon. Rather than abandoning the old ways, [From.GetTitledName] and the most powerful priests have decided to reform their faith. With codified rites, a holy scripture and a strict church hierarchy under a single leader, they hope that the reformed [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is better armed to fight back against the weak and effeminate foreign beliefs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4414;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optB_Plus.4414;We refuse to follow a far away shaman only because he wears the largest hat, we'll start our own reformtion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optC_Plus.4414;Pff nonsense, every man must study the spiritual on his own instead of blindly following the clergy, we'll start our own reformtion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optD_Plus.4414;Reforming, bah! Old way is best way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optE_Plus.4414;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4415;The ancient Finnic religion is proving unable to withstand the onslaught of the Cross and the Moon. Rather than abandoning the old ways, [From.GetTitledName] and the most powerful priests have decided to reform their faith. With codified rites, a holy scripture and a decentralized church hierarchy, they hope that the reformed [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is better armed to fight back against the 'balanceless' foreign beliefs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4415;No, we need more to survive, we need a single spiritual leader, we'll start our own reformation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optB_Plus.4415;We'll join, this sounds like a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optC_Plus.4415;This is wrong, only reason can save us not balance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optD_Plus.4415;Reforming, bah! Old way is best way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
desc_Plus.4416;The ancient Finnic religion is proving unable to withstand the onslaught of the Cross and the Moon. Rather than abandoning the old ways, [From.GetTitledName] and the most powerful priests have decided to reform their faith. With a holy scripture and a new system based on 'rational' investigation of the spiritual world, they hope that the reformed [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is better armed to fight back against the weak and effeminate foreign beliefs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optA_Plus.4416;No, we need more to survive, we need a single spiritual leader, we'll start our own reformation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optB_Plus.4416;This is nonsense, there must be balance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optC_Plus.4416;Sounds logical, we'll follow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
optD_Plus.4416;Reforming, bah! Old way is best way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

finnish_pagan_papal_DESC;A religion based on Finnic paganism, they believe in a law which was brought down from heaven by their gods, and which must be interpreted by their highest priest (a position which onder pressure from secular authority evolved away from a first among equals of the shamans).;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

finnish_pagan_autocephaly_DESC;A religion based on Finnic paganism, they believe in an everlasting war between the spirits of light and dark, warm and cold, fire and ice. Their eternal war created the current world and allowed for the existence of humanity.
