# 00_offmap_powers.txt
#

# this is a new database that is used to create "offmap powers" That is nations not represented on the map but with a significant influence over it
# For example, China

# example:
china = {													# used to name the offmap powers in related scopes, effects and triggers
	name = TXT_CHINA										# the localization line used to represent the name of the offmap_power
	window_name = domestic_offmaps_window					# the name of their UI window (vanilla window is in domestic_offmaps.gui). Means that each offmap can have its own screen.
	button_name = icon_offmaps_entry								# the name of the UI window to use for the button that opens interaction with the offmap power
															# Note that a number of elements cannot be removed/renamed, and that others might have their tooltips broken if renamed
															# Also be aware that deleting the original window type is likely to cause a crash
	currency_name = TXT_GRACE								# the localization line used to represent the name of the currency used in interactions, decisions, etc related to that power. This plus "_desc" will be used for its description
	currency_gain = monthly_grace							# the name of the modifier that gives currency each month. Also needs to be defined in the modifier_definitions folder
	currency_below_zero = yes								# whether the currency can go below 0. Defaults to "no"
	currency_reset_on_dynasty_change = yes					# whether everyone gets their currency set to 0 when a new offmap ruler has a different dynasty from the last one. Defaults to "no"
	holder_title = china_emperor							# the minor title associated with being the overlord of that offmap power
															#	this is not, and should not be accessible to player characters
															#	characters with that minor title will be considered "offmap" and will not be accessible to interactions, events, etc. Events with "offmap = allow" or "offmap = only" can trigger for offmaps - other events will not
															#   This minor title can also not be granted in any way by a character to another, but is obtained automatically when becoming
															#	holder of this offmap power

	governor_title = e_china_west_governor					# the regular landed associated with the offmap_powers, who will be their mean way of influencing the map.
															# the governor title and the governor will act as a normal character and the map (declare wars, tributarize, vassalize, etc)	
															# once again players won't be able to become governor
															# this title should be landless to ensure it always exists
	tier = emperor											# what tier the offmap should be considered. Mostly used for localisation, but the various "tier" triggers also work on offmaps	
	coa_religion = taoist									# what religion's CoA type to use on the offmap screen. If not specified, whatever religion the emperor's dynasty has will be used
	
	display_trigger = { has_dlc = "Jade Dragon" }			# trigger for whether to show the button to open the offmap screen. ROOT is the offmap power. FROM is the player. The trigger is evaluated once a month
	policies = {											# list of valid policies, from the policies database
	}
	statuses = {											# list of valid statuses, from the statuses database
	}

	holder_succession = {									# weighted lists and effects to create a new character to hold the title
															# ROOT is the offmap, FROM is the old holder, FROMFROM is the new holder with what's been filled out so far. Order goes: gender, religion, culture, graphical culture, dynasty. So for religion for example you can refer to gender, but not anything else
		is_female = {										# chances of getting a female holder, as a percentage
															# if the total is >= 100, the new holder will always be female
															# if the totla is <= 0, the new holder will always be male
			value = 5
			additive_modifier = {
				value = 45
				has_game_rule = {
					name = gender
					value = all
				}
			}
		}

		####
		# culture, religion, dynasty, graphical_culture work in exactly the same way: they are weighted value lists
		# culture is used below as an example
		culture = {
			FROM = {										# The left hand side here, is an EventScopeValue, which is a normal keyword (FROM, FROMFROM, ROOT, etc)
															# or a value from the type you want (here, a culture)
															# the right hand side is a normal MTTH  (you can have modifiers to the base value), but only the entry
															# with the highest score will be used.
															# entries with a score of 0 or less will be ignored
				value = 10									# the scope here is the offmap_power, with From being the old holder
			}
			han = {
				value = 1
			}
		}

		### note: default_religion and default_culture have been removed since we now have weighted list, you can just add the culture or religion you want with a weight of 0
	}
	
	diplomatic_range = {}									# Trigger for who is in range of China. Extends the governor's normal diplomatic range. ROOT is the character potentially in range, while FROM is the governor. Note that the governor title must have a capital defined, as this is used if it has no land. If none is defined, everything will be considered in range
	tribute_decisions_trigger								# Trigger for whether to change the frame of the tribute icon. Has no actual gameplay effect, but is useful for showing whether tribute decisions in general are disabled. ROOT is the offmap's governor. FROM is the player
	boon_decisions_trigger									# Like tribute_decisions_trigger, except for boons
	non_aggression_modifier = name							# Name of the temporary modifier used to denote "peace deals" with the offmap power. At the moment only used for display purposes, other than what you do with it in script
}

Unless a death reason is specified, all offmap ruler deaths happen with "death_offmap". This is used to indicate that they used to be an offmap ruler; using another death reason will result in their stats not getting hidden on their character sheet

any_character/random_character does not include offmap rulers, but does include their governor
